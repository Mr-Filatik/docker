## Install

### Install Docker on Windows
Before installing Docker, you need to make sure that virtualization technologies (WSL or Hiper-V) are enabled on your device, which are necessary for Docker to work.
How to check and enable is indicated in [article](https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8-%D0%B2-windows-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1).

Afterwards, you need to download and run the [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) application

## Using
With Docker running, select the image you need and run it. All the commands required for this are listed next to the specific image in the `README.md` files.
